init(self, position):

    Initializes the paddle with a square shape, white color, and fast animation speed.
    Stretches the paddle shape to make it tall and thin (5 units tall, 1 unit wide).
    Lifts the pen to avoid drawing lines when the paddle moves.
    Positions the paddle at the specified coordinates using goto(position).

up(self):

    Moves the paddle up by 20 units.
    Calculates the new y-coordinate by adding 20 units to the current y-coordinate.
    Moves the paddle to the new y-coordinate while keeping the x-coordinate unchanged.

down(self):

    Moves the paddle down by 20 units.
    Calculates the new y-coordinate by subtracting 20 units from the current y-coordinate.
    Moves the paddle to the new y-coordinate while keeping the x-coordinate unchanged.
